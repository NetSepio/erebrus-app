- VPN Metadata: We may collect anonymous VPN session data (e.g., connection duration, server location, protocol, and timestamps) to monitor server performance and prevent abuse.
- Device Data: Information like device type, OS version, and app version may be collected to diagnose issues and improve service quality.

6. Data Sharing

We may work with third-party service providers (e.g., hosting, AI processing, customer support) under strict confidentiality agreements. These providers do not have access to your private browsing or identity data.

7. Security

We take your privacy seriously and implement industry-standard measures such as encryption, secure transmission, and local storage protections. However, no system is 100% secure, and users should take caution when sharing sensitive information.
